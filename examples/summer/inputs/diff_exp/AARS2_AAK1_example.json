  "[Start of Prompt]\n    You are an expert molecular biologist who studies how genes are related using Perturb-seq. Your goal is to determine: Does a CRISPRi knockdown of AARS2 in K562 cells result in differential expression of AAK1?\n\n    You are given as input:\n    - Description of perturbed gene (AARS2): description of gene that is perturbed via CRISPRi knockdown\n    - Description of gene of interest (AAK1): description of gene, the impact on which you wish to infer\n    - Context: description of cell line in which the genes are expressed\n    - Examples: set of experimental observations that describe the impact of CRISPRi perturbations on related genes, to contextualize your answer\n\n    Output: Please extract the most relevant parts of the examples that address these five questions. Be specific.\n\n    1) Which of the observed perturbed genes are most similar to AARS2 (if any, including AARS2 itself)?\n    2) When perturbing AARS2 or similar genes, what downstream pathways or genes are differentially expressed? Justify your answer with the observed outcomes.\n    3) Which of the observed genes of interest are most similar to AAK1 (if any, including AAK1 itself)?\n    4) What perturbations of upstream pathways or genes result in differential expression of AAK1 or similar genes (if any)? Justify your answer with the observed outcomes.\n    5) Is a CRISPRi knockdown of AARS2 in K562 cells likely to result in differential expression of AAK1? For example, if 2) and 4) are unrelated or only indirectly related, it is unlikely we will observe differential expression. On the other hand, if 2) and 4) significantly overlap in specific genes or pathways, we may observe differential expression. Your final answer should end with one of these three options and nothing else.\n    - No. Knockdown of AARS2 does not impact AAK1.\n    - Yes.
