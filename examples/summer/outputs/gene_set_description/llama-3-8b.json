["Brief overview of gene set: The genes in this set are involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is a series of protein complexes that transfer electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen, generating ATP. The genes encode subunits of the complexes, which are essential for the proper functioning of the chain and the generation of energy for the cell.\n\nUpstream pathways may affect this gene set: The expression of these genes may be affected by upstream pathways that regulate the mitochondrial electron transport chain, such as the TCA cycle and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, the expression of these genes may be influenced by compensatory mechanisms that maintain the balance of the electron transport chain, such as the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of antioxidant enzymes.\n\nName of gene set: Mitochondrial electron transport chain subunits\n[End of Output]\n", "1) Brief overview of gene set: The genes in this set are involved in the regulation of cellular stress responses, including the expression of genes involved in antioxidant defense and apoptosis. Additionally, these genes play a role in the maturation of ribosomal RNAs and other non-coding RNAs.\n\n2) Upstream pathways may affect this gene set: The expression of these genes may be influenced by various signaling pathways, including the mTOR and PI3K/AKT pathways, which regulate cell growth and proliferation. Additionally, the expression of these genes may be modulated by chromatin remodeling or transcriptional interference.\n\n3) Name of gene set: Stress response gene set\n[End of Output]\n"]
